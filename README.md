## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* MongoDB (local installation or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
* Cloudinary Account (for media storage)
* Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-social-media-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-social-media-app.git)
cd your-social-media-app

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the server or backend directory (or wherever your backend code resides).

cd server # or backend
npm install

Create a .env file in the server directory and add your environment variables:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

Start the backend server:

npm start

The backend server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the client or frontend directory (or wherever your frontend code resides).

cd ../client # or frontend
npm install

Create a .env file in the client directory (if needed for frontend specific env variables, e.g., API base URL):

REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
# Add any other frontend specific environment variables here

Start the frontend development server:

npm start

The frontend application should now open in your browser, typically on http://localhost:3000.
